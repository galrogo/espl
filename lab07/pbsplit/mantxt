NAME
       pbsplit - split a binary file into several chunks
 
SYNOPSIS
       pbsplit [OPTIONS] FILE
 
DESCRIPTION
       Splits  FILE into several chunks of at most the specified size FILE.01,
       FILE.02, FILE.03 etc. Prepends each chunk with the four-byte  XOR-based
       checksum for integrity control. Generates chunks in several parallel processes
       exploiting multiple CPUs to increase performance.
 
 
OPTIONS
       -b SIZE     put at most SIZE bytes per output file
 
       -h          print summary of options and exit
 
       -x          print the checksum of FILE on the standard output
 
       -p NPROC    maximum number of child processes.
